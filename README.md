What is eZ Yomigana ?
=====================

eZ Yomigana 5.x enables Yomigana ( Ruby ) support extension for eZ Online Editor 5.x.
This extension is a combination of a custom tag, tinyMCE plugin and specific CSS style.


From Wikipedia :

Furigana (振り仮名) is a Japanese reading aid, consisting of smaller kana, or syllabic characters,
printed next to a kanji (ideographic character) or other character to indicate its pronunciation.
It is typically used to clarify rare, nonstandard or ambiguous readings, or in children's or learners' materials.
It is most often written in hiragana, though katakana is used in certain special cases explained
later in the article.
It is one type of ruby text.

Furigana is also known as yomigana (読み仮名) or rubi (ルビ) in Japanese.

Ruby HTML Tag :

In 2001, the W3C published the Ruby Annotation specification[1] for supplementing XHTML with ruby markup.
Ruby markup is not a standard part of HTML 4.01 or any of the XHTML 1.0 specifications
(XHTML-1.0-Strict, XHTML-1.0-Transitional, and XHTML-1.0-Frameset), but was incorporated into the XHTML 1.1
specification, and is expected to be a core part of HTML5 once the specification becomes finalised by the W3C.[2]

Support for ruby markup in web browsers is limited, as XHTML 1.1 is not yet widely implemented. Ruby markup is
partially supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer (5.0+) for Windows and Macintosh, supported by Chrome, but
is not supported by Mozilla, Firefox (though see below), Konqueror or Opera.
